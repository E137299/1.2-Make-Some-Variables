# 1.2-Make-Some-Variables

**Objective:**  
Write a Python script to practice creating variables, assigning them initial values, and reassigning them new values.

**Instructions:**  
**Step 1: Variable Creation and Initial Assignment**

1. Create a variable named `age` and assign it an integer value representing your age.
2. Create a variable named `name` and assign it a string value with your first name.
3. Create a variable named `height` and assign it a float value representing your height in meters.

**Step 2: Output**

4. Print the values of `name`, `age`, and `height`.

**Step 3: Output**

5. Print the statement: "Sometime later ..."


**Step 4: Variable Reassignment**

6. Reassign a new value to the `age` variable to represent your age next year (increment the value by 1).
7. Reassign a new value to the `height` variable to represent a slight change in height (add 1" to the original value).

**Step 5: Output**

8. Print the values of `name`, `age`, and `height` after the reassignment.

**Example**

Assume the initial values are:
- `age = 15`
- `name = "Tom"`
- `height = 5'9"`

After reassignment, if you update `age` to `16` and `height` to `5'10"`, the output should be:
```
Name: Tom
Age: 15
Height: 5'9"

Sometime later ...

Name: Tom
Age: 16
Height: 5'10"
```
