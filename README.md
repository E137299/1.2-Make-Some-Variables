## Objective:
In this assignment, you'll practice creating variables, reassigning variables, casting data types, and printing values with different data types. These are fundamental skills you'll use frequently in Python programming.

### Instructions:
**1) Creating Variables**:
- Create a variable called *name* and assign it your name as a string.
- Create a variable called *age* and assign it your age as an integer.
- Create a variable called *height* and assign it your height in meters (e.g., 1.75) as a float.
- Create a variable called *is_student* and assign it a boolean value indicating whether you are currently a student (True or False).


**3) Printing with Strings (First Time)**:
- Print a sentence that says "Hello, my name is [*name*] and I am [*age*] years old." (use the *name* and *age* variables).
    - Cast the *age* variable to a string in order to join it with the rest of the sentence. Hint: str(number)

**4) Reassigning Variables**:
- Reassign the *age* variable to your age next year.
- Reassign the *height* variable to your estimated height in meters (e.g., 1.78).

**5) Printing with Strings (Second Time)**:
- Print a sentence that says "Next year, I will be [*age*] years old." 
    - Cast the *age* variable to a string in order to join it with the rest of the sentence. Hint: str(number)
- Print a sentence that says "I am [*height*] meters tall." 
    - Cast the *height* variable to a string in order to join it with the rest of the sentence. Hint: str(number)
- Print a sentence that says "It is [*is_student*] that I am currently a student." (use the *is_student* variable).
    - - Cast the *is_student* variable to a string in order to join it with the rest of the sentence. Hint: str(boolean)
